FOR Q4, IT gives 58 rows of output. After entering the psql, it outputs only some of the required result.
-- To see the rest of the result and the number of rows, you need to click and hold enter. I don't why, but that's how it shows the complete outpt.
After the entire output was out, I did \q to go back .
